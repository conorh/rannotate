== Using Rannotate ==

Step 1: Put the rannotate.rb file from the root directory into your
rdoc templates directory which is in:
[RUBY_DIR]\lib\ruby\1.8\rdoc\generators\template\html

Step 2: Modify the rannotate.rb file in the templates directory and do
a search and replace for localhost. Replace it with the IP that the 
rannotate server will be running on. This step
because I can't figure out how to get rdoc to accept custom
parameters.

Step 3: Create the DB using the file in \db and modify the
config\database.yml for your DB setup. The sql inserts a user 'admin'
with the password 'admin'. I did this because I password protected the
signup page so you can't signup a new user without logging in :)

Step 4: Generate some rdoc for your application using:
rdoc --template=rannotate --inline

Step 5: Start webrick for rannotate

Step 6: Open up the index.html of the docs you generated. If you open
it up locally using a file:// url then some links will not work due to
javascript security (URLs on rannotate server cannot open file://
URLs).
