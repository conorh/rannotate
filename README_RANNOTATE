== Using Rannotate == 

Step 1: Put the db_generator.rb file from the rdoc_extension into your
rdoc generator directory which is:
[RUBY_DIR]\lib\ruby\1.8\rdoc\generators\
Put the mysql.rhtml template file from rdoc_extension\templates into:
[RUBY_DIR]\lib\ruby\1.8\rdoc\generators\template\db

Step 3: Create the DB using the file in \db and modify the
config\database.yml for your DB setup. The sql inserts a user 'admin'
with the password 'admin'. I did this because I password protected the
signup page so you can't signup a new user without logging in :)

Step 4: Generate some rdoc for your application using:
rdoc --fmt=db --template=mysql.rhtml

Step 5: Import the generated SQL statements into MySql, you can use:
mysql -u dbuser -p dbname < inserts.sql

Step 6: Start webrick for rannotate

Step 7: Open up the URL of the documentation http://server:3000/doc/
