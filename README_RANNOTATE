== Using Rannotate == 

Step 1: Put the yaml_generator.rb file from the rdoc_extension directory into your
rdoc generator directory which is:
	[RUBY_DIR]\lib\ruby\1.8\rdoc\generators\

Step 3: Setup config\database.yml for your DB and run 'rake migrate'

Step 4: Generate some rdoc for your application using:
	rdoc --fmt=yaml --opname=appname-0.2.3 directory
	
NOTE: The format of the opname parameter MUST be name-[major]-[minor]-[release], or the generation will fail

Step 5: Create an admin login account
ruby script\console
User.create({:login => 'admin', :password => .., :password_confirmation => ..}).save

Step 6: Login to the admin section
Admin URL - http://server:3000/admin/
Login: admin Password: admin

Step 7: Go to the Upload Documentation section and select the appname-0.2.3.out file that was generated at step 4.

Step 8: Open up the URL of the documentation http://server:3000/ and there it is!

== Generating documentation for rails or ruby ==

There are several tasks in the Rannotate Rakefile to help generate the documentation for rails or ruby.

rake doc:api:rails will generate the docs for the current version of rails
rake doc:api:ruby will generate the docs for ruby

These tasks will place the docs in the /doc directory

== Troubleshooting ==

For some reason under rails 1.0 there are issues with importing the documentation using YAML. Please
use later versions of rails.
